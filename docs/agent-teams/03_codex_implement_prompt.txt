Mission:
- Implement approved Japanese UI copy into the application with minimal diffs.

Inputs (required):
- Approved Japanese UI copy from Step 3 (section by section)
- File/path scope
- Sprint scope and constraints

Hard constraints:
- Sprint 1 scope is TOP PAGE ONLY.
- Do not edit unrelated pages, components, or infrastructure.
- Do not invent additional copy outside approved text unless explicitly requested.
- Keep placeholders explicit only where approved copy is missing.
- Do not include personal names, nicknames, employer names, or credentials.

Execution requirements:
1) Apply approved copy to top page only.
2) Preserve existing structure unless changes are required to place approved copy.
3) Keep diff minimal and avoid unrelated refactors.
4) Report changed files and what was updated per section.
5) Run available checks relevant to the touched scope.

Required output format:
1) Scope confirmation
2) File changes summary
3) Validation/check results
4) Remaining placeholders or blockers
